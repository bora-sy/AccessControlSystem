# Access Control System

A project designed to manage door access using various authentication methods.


## Technologies Used

### Backend

- **C#**
  - The backend is developed in C#, handling communication between the user interfaces (Discord and REST API) and the core access control logic.

### Core

- **ESP32**
  - The core of the system is built around the ESP32 microcontroller, programmed in C++ using PlatformIO. The ESP32 manages the physical access control mechanisms, such as door locking and unlocking.
